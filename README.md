## What is ClipCannon?

ClipCannon is an MCP server that turns any AI assistant into a professional video editor + voice clone + meeting avatar. You give it a video file; it analyzes every frame, every word, every emotion, every speaker, every scene -- then exposes **54 tools** that let an AI assistant create edits, render platform-ready clips, generate music, clone voices, and even join Google Meet as a talking AI avatar.

**The core idea**: instead of scrubbing through hours of footage manually, let an AI understand the content through neural embeddings and structured analysis, then have a conversation about what to create.

```

#### 2. Install Ollama (Local LLM)

ClipCannon uses Ollama for local LLM inference (narrative analysis, meeting bot intelligence):

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull the recommended models
ollama pull qwen3:8b-nothink    # Fast responses for real-time conversation
ollama pull qwen3:14b-nothink   # Better quality for analysis tasks
```

#### 3. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Hugging Face token (needed to download gated models like Whisper, Wav2Vec2)
export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here

# Optional: Set GPU device
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to persist across sessions.

#### 4. Connect to Claude

**Claude Code (CLI):**
```bash
claude mcp add clipcannon -- clipcannon
```

**Claude Desktop:**

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clipcannon": {
      "command": "clipcannon",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Verify Installation

Tell Claude:
```
Run clipcannon_config_list and tell me if the GPU is detected correctly.
Then run clipcannon_project_list to verify the MCP connection works.
```

### WSL2 Setup (Windows Users)

If you're running on Windows via WSL2, additional setup is needed for audio:

```
I'm on WSL2. Please set up PulseAudio TCP bridge for audio capture.
I need:
1. PulseAudio installed on Windows with TCP module enabled on port 4713
2. WSL2 PULSE_SERVER pointing to the Windows host
3. Output and clone_audio sinks configured
4. Firewall rule for port 4713
```

## Using ClipCannon with Claude

### Getting Started Prompts

Once ClipCannon is connected, here are prompts to learn the system:

#### Learn What's Available
```
What ClipCannon tools do you have access to? Give me a categorized overview.
```

```
Explain the ClipCannon video analysis pipeline. What happens when I ingest a video?
```

#### Analyze Your First Video
```
Create a project from /path/to/my/video.mp4 and run the full analysis pipeline.
Show me the results when it's done.
```

```
Show me the transcript of the video we just analyzed. Who are the speakers?
```

```
What are the best highlight moments in this video? Show me the top 5.
```

#### Create Edits
```
Create a 60-second TikTok highlight reel from the best moments.
Use adaptive captions and face-tracking crop.
```

```
Find all the moments where the speaker talks about [topic] and create a
compilation clip for YouTube Shorts.
```

```
Create a split-screen edit showing two speakers side by side during
their debate. Add lower-third captions.
```

#### Voice Cloning
```
Create a voice profile from this video's speaker. I want to clone their voice.
```

```
Using the voice profile we just created, generate speech saying:
"Welcome to our channel! Don't forget to subscribe."
```

```
Generate a lip-synced talking-head video of the speaker saying a new script.
```

#### AI Audio
```
Generate background music for this clip. I want something upbeat and energetic,
around 120 BPM, that fits the mood of the highlights.
```

```
Create a cinematic intro sound effect for the beginning of this video.
```

```
Clean up the audio in this clip - reduce background noise and normalize levels.
```

### Workflow Examples

#### Content Creator Workflow
```
I have a 2-hour podcast recording. I need:
1. Analyze the full video
2. Find the 10 best moments (most engaging, emotional, or funny)
3. Create 5 separate 60-second TikTok clips from those moments
4. Each clip should have captions, face-tracking crop, and be 1080x1920
5. Render all 5 clips

Start with the analysis and show me what you find.
```

#### Meeting Recap Workflow
```
Analyze this meeting recording. I need:
1. Full transcript with speaker identification
2. Summary of key topics discussed
3. Action items and decisions made
4. A 3-minute highlight clip of the most important moments
```

#### Voice Clone Workflow
```
I want to create a voice clone from this interview video:
1. Analyze the video to find the best voice samples
2. Create a voice profile (aim for SECS > 0.95)
3. Test the clone by generating a sample sentence
4. If quality is good, generate a full intro script with the cloned voice
```

### Power User Prompts

```
Show me the scene map for this project. I want to understand the visual layout
of each scene so I can plan my edit.
```

```
Search the video content for any mention of "product launch" or "quarterly results".
Show me timestamps and context.
```

```
Compare the editing context between scene 3 and scene 7.
Which would work better as an opening shot?
```

```
Find safe cut points near the 2-minute mark. I need a clean transition
that doesn't interrupt mid-sentence.
```

```
Create a branch of my current edit. I want to try a different opening
without losing my original version.
```

### Voice Agent ("Jarvis")

ClipCannon includes a standalone real-time voice assistant:

```bash
# Start the voice agent
python -m voiceagent talk --voice boris

# WebSocket server for remote clients
python -m voiceagent serve --port 8765
```

Ask Claude to set it up:
```
Set up the Jarvis voice agent with wake word detection.
I want it to listen for "Hey Jarvis" and respond using my voice clone.
Use Ollama with qwen3:8b for fast responses.
```

### Meeting Bot (Santa/Avatar)

Join Google Meet as an AI-powered avatar:

```
Launch the Santa meeting bot on this Google Meet link: [URL]
It should:
1. Load all models into VRAM before joining
2. Listen continuously and respond when addressed
3. Use the Santa voice clone with full prosody
4. Respond within 2 seconds of being asked a question
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "How much VRAM do I need?"

- **8GB** -- Can run core analysis (one model at a time). Slower but functional.
- **16GB** -- Comfortable for analysis + editing + basic voice work.
- **24GB (RTX 4090)** -- Full pipeline including voice cloning and avatar generation.
- **32GB (RTX 5090)** -- Everything concurrent, real-time meeting bot with TTS + ASR + LLM simultaneously.

### "Can I run this without a GPU?"

The analysis pipeline requires CUDA. Editing and rendering work on CPU but are much slower without NVENC. The voice agent requires a GPU.

### "What about Mac/Apple Silicon?"

Not currently supported. The pipeline depends heavily on CUDA, PyTorch CUDA, and NVENC. MPS support is planned for a future release.

### "How long does analysis take?"

Depends on video length and GPU:
- 5-minute video on RTX 4090: ~2-3 minutes
- 1-hour video on RTX 4090: ~15-20 minutes
- The 23-stage DAG runs in parallel, so more GPU = faster

### "Is my data sent anywhere?"

No. Everything runs locally. All models run on your GPU. All data stays in SQLite on disk. No cloud APIs are called. The only network calls are model downloads from Hugging Face (first run only) and optional Ollama API (which also runs locally).

---
